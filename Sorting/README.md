# Sorting Algorithms (Java)

This directory contains implementations of commonly used **sorting algorithms** written in **Java**, as part of my **DSA preparation journey**.

The goal is to understand:
- How each sorting algorithm works
- Their time and space complexities
- When to use which sorting technique

---

## 📂 Contents

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

Each algorithm is implemented from scratch with clear logic for learning purposes.

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Algorithm        | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Bubble Sort      | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)  |
| Selection Sort   | O(n²)     | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)  |
| Insertion Sort   | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)  |
| Merge Sort       | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(n)  |
| Quick Sort       | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n²)      | O(log n) |

## 🎯 Learning Focus

- Compare **stable vs unstable** sorting
- Understand **in-place vs extra space** algorithms
- Identify best sorting algorithm for different scenarios
